"""Probe batteries: run a fixed set of prompts through a model, before and
after an edit, and report exactly what moved.

This is the collateral-damage microscope. Point it at (base, finetune),
(fp16, int4), or (model, model-under-an-edit) and get a per-prompt table:
which predictions flipped, which degraded, which held. `tags` group the
prompts so "broke 3 capitals, held 40 unrelated" is one line.

Small models are the point: on a 135M model you can afford a few hundred
probes per edit and actually chart the efficacy/specificity frontier that
knowledge-editing papers on 7B models can only sample.
